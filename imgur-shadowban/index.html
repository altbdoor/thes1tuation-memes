<h3 id="first-failure-possible-flooding">First failure, possible flooding</h3>

<p>At about <time datetime="2023-05-23T15:17:34+08:00">May 23, 2023, 3:17 PM</time>,
I tried updating the website with some tags, but the build failed.
The HTTP error was 429, which was commonly known as imgur&#39;s response
to high traffic.</p>

<p>I could not be spamming imgur servers, I rarely update the site even.
But then again, I remember the <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/12sbch3/imgur_is_updating_their_tos_on_may_15_2023_all/" referrerpolicy="noreferrer">imgur NSFW fiasco</a>,
which <em>might</em> have triggered some people to start archiving from GitHub CI servers.</p>

<p>I tried the usual bypassing by faking the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">User-Agent</code>, but imgur servers
replied with the same HTTP 429. That led me to believe that it is probably
an IP range block, and GitHub CI servers are blocked.</p>

<p>Defeated, I generated the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">imgur.json</code> data file, hosted it on a third party
website, and get the GitHub CI servers to fetch from there instead. This worked
for once, and I thought things would improve after a week or so.</p>

<h3 id="second-failure-album-is-404">Second failure, album is 404</h3>

<p>At about <time datetime="2023-05-26T17:53:26+08:00">May 26, 2023, 5:53 PM</time>,
I tried updating the site again. This time, the error was… odd. It is a HTTP 404.</p>

<p>I tried opening the <a href="https://imgur.com/a/yzKq60n" referrerpolicy="noreferrer">album link</a>, and it works for me.
I tried replaying the API call on my local machine, to get all the album images,
and it is still HTTP 404.</p>

<div class="language-console highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">$</span><span class="w"> </span>curl <span class="nt">-I</span> <span class="nt">-H</span> <span class="s1">&#39;Authorization: Client-ID xxx&#39;</span> <span class="s1">&#39;https://api.imgur.com/3/album/yzKq60n/images&#39;</span>
<span class="go">HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Length: 4323
</span><span class="gp">content-type: text/html;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">charset</span><span class="o">=</span>utf-8
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I was stumped. My album is there, but it is not there. I told myself,
it is only one image that is going to be updated anyways. I will wait it out
for a week or so.</p>

<p>For what its worth, the <a href="https://status.imgur.com/" referrerpolicy="noreferrer">imgur status page</a> has been
&#34;fixing&#34; an issue since May 12.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote ps-3 border-start border-4 border-success">

<h3 id="third-failure-album-is-404-for-friends">Third failure, album is 404 for friends</h3>

<p>After a couple of days, I hung out in Twitch chat with a couple of friends.
I was informed that they could no longer access the album, and they see a 404 page.
Once again, works on my local machine. Curious, I opened a private tab in Firefox,
and voila, HTTP 404.</p>

<p>I did not receive any notice about how or why the album is returning HTTP 404,
from imgur. I think it <em>might</em> be that one NSFW meme, but I could not be sure.
At <time datetime="2023-05-28T11:50:23+08:00">May 28, 2023, 11:50 AM</time>,
I pushed some new Python code that fetches from a different API.</p>

<div class="language-diff highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gi">+ f&#34;https://api.imgur.com/post/v1/albums/{album_hash}?include=media,tags,account&#34;
</span><span class="gd">- f&#34;https://api.imgur.com/3/album/{album_hash}/images&#34;
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>This uses an officially undocumented API, which appears to be used by
<a href="https://github.com/mikf/gallery-dl/blob/v1.25.5/gallery_dl/extractor/imgur.py#L413" referrerpolicy="noreferrer">major scraping libraries</a>.
This fixes the API part, and I had to make some adjustments to the data models.</p>

<p>But the album is still 404, so.</p>

<h3 id="maybe-it-is-time-to-panic">Maybe it is time to panic</h3>

<p>I did panic a little when I heard about the <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/12sbch3/imgur_is_updating_their_tos_on_may_15_2023_all/" referrerpolicy="noreferrer">imgur NSFW fiasco</a>. I did make
<em>some</em> preparations in case I get forced to close shop, and evaluated some
alternatives. In the end, I concluded that the images should be fine, and I would
backup the images regularly, in expectance of closing shop.</p>

<p>With how things are going right now, I will be publishing all the links to whatever
backup I have. Things are a little scattered, but this is not exactly a
world class project to begin with. I just rolled with whatever worked for me.</p>

<p>If you want to use the data, some notes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The images are a direct ZIP download from imgur (e.g., <a href="https://imgur.com/a/yzKq60n/zip" referrerpolicy="noreferrer">https://imgur.com/a/yzKq60n/zip</a>),
so the order of the images (like the album view), is messed up. You will
probably have to cross reference the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">imgur.json</code> to order it properly.</li>
  <li>The image ZIP does not have the thumbnails.</li>
  <li>The tags are in YAML because I was too lazy to write JSON. The keys are the
imgur ID, and values are text tags.</li>
  <li>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">imgur.json</code> has all the basic data. To note a few, the imgur ID, created timestamp,
size, file size, and others.</li>
</ol>

<p>I will still be maintaining this website from time to time. If imgur really forces
me to close shop, I will re-setup things on a different host. Keeping the site
up is the least I could do.</p>

<p>Good luck, and have fun.</p>
